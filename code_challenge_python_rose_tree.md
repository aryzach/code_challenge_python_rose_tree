# Python Rose Tree
## Description
* In Python create a class representing a rose (multi-way) tree.
* Include methods to:
  * Get a value from a specified position in the tree.
  * Replace a value at a specified position in the tree.
  * Insert a tree into a specified position within another tree.
  * Explain (no need to actually implement) how you'd design a method to move a sub-tree from one location to another within the parent. Are there any special considerations for this in comparison to the previously mentioned methods?

## Notes:
* Description of a rose tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_tree -- the article contains two sample definitions of a rose tree, apologies if you don't have exposure to FP as both are in Haskell. The first one is probably better to prime your intuition for how rose trees are constructed. The square brackets used have a similar meaning as they would in Python, an ordered indexable list (with duplicate values allowed).
* No format has been prescribed to specify positions in the tree, please feel free to use whatever format youâ€™d like
* Use doctest to include some basic sanity tests to show the methods you've created function as intended.
* Please perform git commits as you work to show your progress.
